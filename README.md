# Workflow template

This repository contains a [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow
template that can be used as the basis for creating new workflows.

> This workflow is not intended to be used by end users.

## Introduction

This workflow provides a simple way to analyse Monkeypox sequencing data; taking raw Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads and creating a draft consensus and assembly. No trimming of sequences is carried out so be vigilant when using targeted data.
## Quickstart

The workflow uses [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage compute and
software resources, as such nextflow will need to be installed before attempting
to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to provide isolation of
the required software. Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided
either docker of conda is installed.

It is not required to clone or download the git repository in order to run the workflow.

**Workflow options**

To obtain the workflow, having installed `nextflow`, users can run:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-mpx --help
```

to see the options for the workflow.

**Workflow outputs**

The primary outputs of the workflow include:

* a simple text file providing a summary of sequencing reads,
* an HTML report document detailing the primary findings of the workflow.
* a draft consensus sequence obtained
* a medaka polished assembly
